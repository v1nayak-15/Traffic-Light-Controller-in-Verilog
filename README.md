# Traffic-Light-Controller-in-Verilog
This project implements a digital traffic light controller using Verilog HDL and simulates it with counters and a testbench. The design is based on a finite state machine (FSM) that controls the traffic flow between North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions.
